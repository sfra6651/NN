The goal is to be able to classify the MNIST dataset which compromises of about 50,000 thousand 28*28 pixel images of hand 
drawn digits and the corresponding labels. Currently with a simple unoptimised config can get it up to 90% on training data.
This is pretty much exactly as expected. Fairly confident I understand the basics now.

The purpose of this was to gain a better understanding on NN's. After using python to do a sanity check I reevaluated the 
decision to use C++. I should have started with python first then migrated to c++. Instead of abandoning the project I am going to go
forward in python and yeet all the garbage C++ code into the sunset. I may come back to C++ and attempt to do an implementation,
however this will be with maximum external library support with the intent to make it blazing fast.
