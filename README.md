The goal is to be able to classify the MNIST dataset which compromises of a few thousant 28*28 pixle images of hand drawn digits and the corrosponding labels.

Crucial Tasks still to do:
  - add in biases
  - batch proccessing
  - support for different activation functions at different layers

Nice to have, time dependant:
  - parrallize batching and matrix operation, optimize matrix operations in general
  - visualizations for loss and error at various layers
  - BIG refactor to clean things up, particulary layer storage.
