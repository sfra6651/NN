Simple Feed Forawrd Neuaral Net.
The goal is to be able to classify the MNIST dataset which compromises of a few thousant 28*28 pixle images of hand drawn digits and the corrosponding labels.

Current testing with stochastic gradient decent the network appears to be collapsing. I decided to write an implementation 
in python as a sanity check and that works, meaning its an implementation issue.

The purpose of this to gain a better understanding on NN's. After using python to do a sanity check I am reevaluating the 
decision to use C++. I do not feel that I am getting better at C++. Instead of abandoning the project I am going to go
forward in python and yeet all the garbage C++ code into the sunset. I may come back to C++ and attempt to do an implementation,
however this will be with maximum external library support with the intent to make it blazing fast.
